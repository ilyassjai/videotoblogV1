# Integrating Knowledge Graphs in Enterprise Information Systems

In the realm of Knowledge Graph (KG) projects, sustainability hinges on seamless integration within the overarching enterprise information system. This integration is achieved through several key strategies:

## Data Lake Integration

The knowledge graph is strategically positioned atop the data lake, facilitating efficient data management and accessibility.

## Data Quality Assurance

Ensuring the integrity of KG data, rigorous data quality checks are conducted, with feedback loop mechanisms in place to address any discrepancies.

## Data Governance Alignment

Harmonizing ontology and taxonomy terms with Data Governance software guarantees that KG mappings align seamlessly with metadata fields.

## Master Data Management (MDM) Collaboration

The knowledge graph generates unique identifiers for resources, fostering a bidirectional flow of information with MDM software to maintain data consistency.

## Leveraging Data Science Capabilities

Exporting the KG to Databricks Graph Frames empowers the creation of predictive analytics models, unlocking valuable insights for informed decision-making.

By adhering to these integration practices, organizations can optimize the utility and effectiveness of their Knowledge Graph initiatives within the broader enterprise context.
