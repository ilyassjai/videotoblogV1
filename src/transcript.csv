5.12,29.601,hello I'm FR sha I will in this video present you the research results in ontology mediation in the SE project we want to demonstrate that it is possible to create uniformally
17.72,40.839999999999996,different information sources by using mediation techniques in this example we relate the databas database of the digital library
29.08,49.12,developed by Bri Telecom to Pro the proton onology developed by onext let's first quate the the proton
38.68,59.0,onology without using any mediation technique I have here a little
48.6,70.84,program that load the proton onology and its Associated knowledge base into the reonal Kon it then execute a query
64.519,87.88000000000001,here to retrieve articles from the knowledge base the query is a sparkle query let's execute it and have a look to the
79.52,107.239,results the program connect to the Reasoner load the onology and query we can that we have two
92.52,118.19999999999999,instances two articles returned by this query let's see now how to create the mapping between proton and the digital library using the
105.439,129.0,tool from onto priz onto map we will now realize the mapping between proton and a digital library using onto map we have open the
122.96,146.44,ontologies and we will try to locate the entities to be related in our case articles an article is an entity it is
135.92,157.201,an object it is a statement an information resource a document and is published
153.2,177.278,here is the concept article in the proton onology the database schema has no hierarchy tables are modeled as
166.48,189.361,concept we directly find the article table and we relate it to the article concept as there are equivalent concept
177.28,197.4,we can realize the B directional mapping conference papers are also articles and journal articles are
188.04,212.599,obviously also articles not now that our mapping has been realized we can export it to the mapping store that will store it until we need
200.12,221.159,it for execution time we use the mapping store result select project and the directory where it will be
222.959,249.31900000000002,stored here is this okay the mapping has been correctly exported we can now return to our query
238.68,259.241,program and see how the mapping will improve our results we have modified the program that now loads the mapping from the
254.079,275.84000000000003,store into the Reser together with the proton onology and the database schema we will execute the query again and see what are the
268.6,292.64000000000004,differences the program now open the mapping store to retrieve the mapping export it to all rules and query a
281.4,303.0,game as we can see we have more results the two results coming from the proton knowledge base are there but now
293.12,315.04,we also have two conference papers and two Journal articles instance we have demonstrated that using mapping
307.16,333.761,we can integrate different information sources this can be extended to as many information sources as we want we will provide support to more
322.88,344.0,complex queries as well as automation of the mapping discovery thank you for your attention and see you
337.96,340.96,soon
