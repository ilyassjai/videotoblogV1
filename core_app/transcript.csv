0.03,22.080000000000002,all right so this is the slide that is on the screen while everybody is sitting down you're probably a little bit nervous right now it's probably best to put your Twitter up there so at least in
12.87,35.189,our industry people like to tweet about you know what's going to happen one quick tactical thing before we get started I use caffeine app if you click right here the little coffee cup I've got a link below that keeps your screen
24.359,45.0,bright and that's great for doing podcast presentations stuff like that so you want to keep clicking your your trackpad to keep it open all right so what I say we get started this is not going to be a very long presentation
34.29,54.32,today we're going to be talking about how to present everybody knows TED talks everybody knows that presentations are a great way to share your message but I
43.67,65.219,found it very difficult to create talks and hopefully this talk will make it easier for you I am NOT a guru and I am NOT a professional speaker and that's part of the reason why I feel the need
54.719,75.41900000000001,to make this post when I google around for how to make a presentation when people were starting to ask me to speak at their events and I was speaking at my own I wasn't fine that the simple type
64.739,87.0,of advice that I needed I do have some experience though because I throw conferences that hundreds of entrepreneurs come to I get some of the best in the business to speak and I watch them have been taking notes
75.96,98.939,furiously and I'm trying to create a system here that can allow us to see similar kinds of success that they see so here's what you'll get if you listen to today's presentation a method for
87.659,110.4,making presentations quickly quickly as Mike II think what I cared about concrete tips on how to keep it interesting and a 16 slide template that you can copy in fact I'll embed a little
99.45,119.88,tip here I should have said I'm going to save you time help you make presentations quicker I'm going to help you make them more interesting and I'm going to give you the whole template so you can just download it and start
109.29,131.219,making yours today that's a simple way to make your slides a little bit more visually interesting to increase your slide velocity so first let me talk about the problem just a little bit more I want to explain the problem so you
120.84,143.421,understand exactly why you need to solve it this is my business partner Ian and he's a busy president of a company so he spends all week long day in and day out running a company when someone asked him
132.18,152.21,to speak at an event it can be an incredibly taxing event in fact for this event which happened in Bangkok a year ago it took him two weeks
140.78,160.88,to prepare his slides and I wanted to help guys like Ian go from two weeks to like two hours the presentation I'm showing you right now took me an hour to
152.12,174.59,make and I'll show you exactly how I made it also it sucks when you go to a conference and you spend all of your time cramming in your hotel room finishing your speech rather than
162.35,183.23,hanging out with cool people and I also wanted to help empower people like Peter Keller from fringe sport Peter Keller gave actually he doesn't need myopia gave one of the best talks
173.27,196.07,at my last conference and I've used a lot of the lessons I've learned from Peter in my framework but what I wanted to help people with is most people that are watching this probably aren't
184.94,206.45,professional speakers and neither is Peter and those are the people that that are in some ways even the most interesting people to have speak because you're building your story every day by
195.68,217.25,growing your business whatever it is that you do wouldn't it be great if you had a simple framework so you could just go out there and share your story like Peter did and inspire hundreds of entrepreneurs all right I've worked you
206.51,228.19899999999998,into a presentation within a presentation I want to show you exactly how these sixteen slides can go to work for you so you can tell your story fast and I'm going to tell a quick little
216.799,239.60000000000002,story about a blog post that I wrote one time called learn to play the guitar in ten hours let's imagine that someone from a school calls me and say we'd love for you to come in and share this with
227.63,250.07,our with our students you know the old Dan might have said hey that's going to take me two weeks to make a presentation but now I'm thinking hey I saw that video online about how to make presentations fast why don't I just try
239.75,264.979,it out all right so I have all the slides numbered one to sixteen basically you're going to remove my information and put in yours so instead of having your title of this maybe put in a photo
251.87,276.45,and a nice cover page like that not so nice but nice you I'm sure you'll do a better job than me all right so you start off with what are we going to learn and what I want you to think about is I want you to delete my words and put
264.89,285.33,in imagery that support your story or your point so what are we going to learn today we're going to learn we're going to leet that how to play some songs from your greatest
275.159,298.34999999999997,artists in the amount of time it takes one to commute to work spend a full day at the office and commute back home why should you listen to me because I have no musical talent you'd have managed to be on the radio
286.8,307.009,and play in bands in front of hundreds of people and I've taught a lot of my friends this technique that I use to play the guitar even though I don't I wasn't born with a piano in my hands
296.629,320.78900000000004,specifically today you're going to learn how to play songs like run around from Blues Traveler and accidentally in love by Counting Crows and country roads by John Denver among hundreds of other
308.729,329.698,songs you could potentially play with the information I'm going to share with you today let me share with you the problem so again you're thinking about how you can this is a world net slide
318.779,340.40999999999997,number five how you can remove this text and put in imagery that supports your points the problem did it up by the way
330.12,353.49,if you're really in a tight spot for time you can even like leave the problem and then sort of prompt you and then to put the imagery on the next slide so the problem is is that you know people say
341.52,363.47999999999996,that you need to practice have a teacher that you need to learn to read music you know you name it you need to have musical talent all these kinds of things but I found a simple solution and here's
353.49,375.84000000000003,what it is actually put in size for this you need to know these five shapes they're very awkward they make your hand hurt you need to hold your hand in there for 10 hours so basically it's a muscle memory
363.99,388.291,thing it's not a musical talent thing it's just a mechanical thing so here's the portion of the presentation so again you know your solution could go on it
376.11,397.949,could be a story or the problem in particular you could you could tell stories about the problem depending on how long you have onstage and I'll tell you how to determine that at the end okay so now we after we've presented our
387.0,409.03,solution we go to the before and after slide and basically what this is is a sequence of sharing what your life was like before you knew about the solution after so you know with the guitar thing
398.13,419.739,you know before I couldn't get a date after now I play guitar I can get a date before I you know didn't realize the you know the the wonderfulness of being a
409.179,431.89,musician be able to jam with other people and be able to go to concerts and like understand what's happening and and now I've got all that and before I thought you know it's gonna be hopeless for me and I was never going to be playing musical instrument and now I
420.189,440.37800000000004,play in a band and I'm on the radio and I playing a banjo club on the weekends so you're at point 14 so slide 14 so you're towards the end of your talk now
430.179,451.719,and people are probably ready to implement whatever you said now is the time to take a moment to step back and say all right so if you're going to do all this stuff there are some common roadblocks that you want to look out for
440.589,462.819,with guitar you know you know you want to make sure that you spend your whole entire ten hours with your hand on the guitar else you won't get the muscle memory required you want to make sure that you fret your notes very close to
452.259,474.82,the fret you know I said your Etta and if you still are feeling them you know pumped up about all this here specifically what you can do to take action on all the things that I taught you today
463.3,485.559,your final slide is actually surprisingly important because it'll be up on the screen for 15 minutes or however long your Q&A is so make sure
473.889,494.649,that you put some useful information and some nice imagery there so that while you're you know answering for 15 minutes people can go to a URL I especially
484.449,509.499,recommend putting a special URL where there's special information for the specific audience that you're talking to as well as social media all right so what about timing then I would recommend
496.749,519.8190000000001,at a minimum two slides a minute and what that's going to mean is that with our basic 16 slide framework you're going to have an eight-minute presentation if you just fill out the
508.149,528.34,basic slides what if I told you this presentation uses the 16 slide format so if you do your own thing you can come back and look at this presentation and sort of see how I rift off of these
518.529,539.649,parts to create this presentation in an hour now some of you might be thinking alright Dan isn't this completely arbitrary you said two slides a minute two of the slides don't even have any
529.99,551.471,talk over them because it's at the end you know isn't this completely arbitrary and the answer is yeah it is arbitrary it's just a handrail this isn't a train track you can do whatever
539.62,561.13,you want with it what I found is that by having no creative framework by having no like here's the problem here's the solution I kind of just spun my wheels and by creating a framework and just
551.26,575.56,dumping stuff in maybe some of these parts don't work for you and that's awesome just fix them at that time rather than trying to reinvent the wheel at the very beginning all right so let me tell you about something that a story
563.5,585.01,that happened before I found out about or I developed a simple framework my friend Rob walling said Dan I'd like you to fly to Prague to speak with my audience of entrepreneurs and it's
574.0,596.92,basically about the coolest email you could ever receive and unfortunately my response was to be terrified of speaking in front of people and to be scared so I
585.97,606.82,didn't I wasn't sure I could provide value and the second thing was is I was thinking back to IANS talk and I was like well I don't know if I have two weeks to go talk to somebody else's
595.99,621.13,audience and I know that would be amazing but like that's two weeks and I just started doing all the calculations in my head but I realized this is the dumbest thinking ever why not just create a framework and put my story into
607.45,629.6500000000001,it and so I got on an airplane and ended up having one of the best weeks of the year for me it was such a cool experience to be able to go out and again this is why I'm creating this is
619.48,643.48,that just by creating a simple framework I enabled myself to visit a brand new City brand new people stay in my rhythm continue to be productive and have a total blast and here's me with the other
631.48,652.33,speakers at mica comp being a speaker at the conference made all the difference and to be honest I was just going to fly in for the weekend to attend the show and by stepping up and doing a talk it
642.16,663.4599999999999,made the experience that much better for me before I had a simple framework my brain was like a Rubik's Cube it was like I had like all the things that I knew in there like podcasting and
652.54,675.91,business and travel and stuff and just having this framework for putting together slides like you know everybody has different levels of competence for me like I can make a blog post pretty quick because I've been doing that for 10 years but I've only done a few
664.39,688.009,presentations so I just couldn't find this on the web you know before and now after I just tell my story and I can get things done quick and get a first draft of if you
675.779,699.63,say to me any you know go make a presentation about podcasting I can use a 16 slide framework to get done in an hour so by implementing this simple 16
687.93,708.5699999999999,step framework or 16 slide framework we've literally reduced the amount of time we spend spinning our wheels on creating a presentation from two weeks to two hours or so so if you were to
697.95,722.4590000000001,challenge me and say hey Dan I want you to give a 15 or 20 minute talk to my audience about podcasting or about blogging or about e-commerce or whatever
710.61,733.589,we've all got those stories inside of us so now I just don't have to worry about the framework I can just tell the story visa view the slides and then if you want to spend the next two weeks turning it into an epic presentation because
722.399,746.88,it's at a really big conference or you're a perfectionist whatever cool you've got your first draft shipped and I want to be clear that this presentation is my first draft so it's
733.829,756.299,I'm keeping it deliberately just sort of a piece so that you could see that like I just pump this out and that's the point is that you get it out the door and then you can do with it what you want all
745.47,768.2710000000001,right so if you want to use this framework there's some common mistakes that people make I just want to go over them really quick the biggest one is that they over rely on their slides to remember their points and put all the info on the screen so the audience reads
756.93,781.829,ahead of them and it's boring a lot of people just put up the slide just like this and then the whole audience just like poof lies down at the bottom and it's no good people aren't even looking at you they're staring at the screen so
769.079,790.8299999999999,instead I say just go if you need to prompt give yourself one word or two words and one picture so if I want to tell myself or tell you a story about the time that I learned how to tell
780.18,802.0799999999999,stories I would do this and hopefully it would well by the way don't ever do that that's the absolute worst I don't know why people do this replace it with something like this just tell stories
791.1,816.03,eventually as you get to this you know people aren't going and people going to get the visual vibe of your slides and then they're going to look to you to hear that story I think people in general overdue the biography element of their
803.07,824.34,talks so you know you guys if you're coming here to this website to learn how to give a presentation you probably don't care about what my business does you can learn more about me anyway pretty easily afterwards so I'm here to
814.62,837.48,teach you how to make a presentation so only bring up the elements of your biography that's buttresses the before and after points so you know tell the narrative story of like or the case study of the thing that you did before
825.69,847.0200000000001,and then after but forget about the whole general here's Who I am thing finally detail detail detail detail in our industry in particular we're talking about internet businesses and it blows
836.4,859.47,me away how rarely people just take a screenshot of their website and show us like here's what's going on like here's the before here's the after so screenshot arrows show me data show
847.26,869.34,me specifics that the specifics really bring out the general principle that you're talking about so if you liked this presentation and you want to make
859.29,883.4399999999999,presentations fast what you can do to act now and take advantage of what I shared is make a presentation today why not on anything just practice pump one out you can download our guide it's right below the video you can improve it
870.81,891.5699999999999,and share in fact this might even be a business opportunity if you could create a bunch of different frameworks that maybe we're modeled off of some of the best talks that were ever given and it's
881.55,906.27,like well you know Dan your framework is nice but I got to give a biography speech or I got to give an X kind of speech there's probably a bunch of different formats that work and I'd love to hear how you could improve on my
892.74,916.35,format and tropical mba.com slash presentation if you're watching this on youtube or on another site is where you can come to talk about this method and to improve upon it and to share what
905.67,930.27,works for you I'm sure a lot of you out there are great at making presentations but maybe don't talk about it in terms of like what should go in slide number seven and that just turns out to be
916.98,938.52,helpful for me finally here is my send away slide so here's what I'd put up for Q&A put up a nice piece of photography I'd let conference attendees know where
929.01,951.8679999999999,they can find out more again if you're on YouTube come to tee mba.com slash presentation and you can give me a shout on Twitter if you want to connect thanks for watching hope it helps
