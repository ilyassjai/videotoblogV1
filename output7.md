## Project Overview
The core objective of the project was to develop a social network that would allow bankers to efficiently discover and connect with relevant companies and executives based on specific criteria. This network utilized a Knowledge Graph that integrated various data sources, including internal databases and vendor-provided information.

## Enhancements and Features
- **Data Integration**: The social graph incorporated existing data sources from previous applications while also adding new sources to enhance its scope.
- **Scale and Performance**: Significant enhancements were made to ensure the network could handle a large volume of data and user interactions effectively.
- **Mobile and Desktop Applications**: Two distinct applications were developed, catering to both mobile and desktop users for seamless accessibility.
- **Connectivity Features**: Users could inquire about contacting specific individuals, executives at particular companies, or obtaining contact lists based on predefined criteria.

## Evolution of Criteria and Functionality
The project evolved from assisting bankers in identifying relevant companies based on specific criteria to enabling automated alerts based on user-defined parameters. This progression facilitated proactive engagement with companies and executives aligned with the bankers' interests and preferences.

## Integration of Social Networking Features
To further enhance connectivity and streamline communication, an Enterprise social network was developed on top of the existing platform. This expansion required scaling the Knowledge Graph significantly and incorporating additional data sources to support a broader network of relationships.

## Conclusion
The development of this social network within the banking sector marked a significant advancement in fostering collaboration and information sharing among industry professionals. By leveraging advanced data integration techniques and innovative networking functionalities, the project aimed to revolutionize how bankers interact and engage with companies and executives within their domain.
