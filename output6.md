## Knowledge Graph Project Strategy

When embarking on a Knowledge Graph project within an Enterprise, it is crucial to start small and demonstrate value quickly. The initial focus should be on developing an end-user application that utilizes the Knowledge Graph. By proving the usefulness of the application, you can then gradually expand the Knowledge Graph and its domain.

### Starting Small

Begin with a small end-user application to showcase the capabilities of the Knowledge Graph. This approach allows for rapid validation of the project's viability and sets the foundation for future expansions.

### Scaling Up

As success is achieved with the initial application, gradually expand the Knowledge Graph and incorporate additional data sources. This iterative process not only demonstrates the scalability of the project but also reduces the cost of developing new applications.

### Project Progression

After establishing a solid foundation with smaller applications, aim for more ambitious projects that leverage the matured Knowledge Graph. One such example is an email alert system designed for investment bankers to track company news and engage with executives effectively.

### Implementation Details

The project involved integrating banker interests, company news, and internal databases into the Knowledge Graph. By developing a comprehensive ontology to represent entities such as companies, persons, and events, the system efficiently facilitated the alerting process.

By following a progressive and iterative approach, organizations can effectively harness the power of Knowledge Graphs to enhance decision-making and drive innovation in their operations.
