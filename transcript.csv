3.29,26.96,welcome to our first video on giving a 10 to 15 minute scientific presentation in this video we'll explain how to create an introduction for such a presentation when you might give in a laboratory discussion group or in a
15.57,37.69,brief talk you might give to colleagues because you have only 10 to 15 minutes for your presentation in this format you will need to be extremely concise carefully choosing your words and your
26.01,48.42,slides these brief presentations are often more challenging than providing a longer presentation this is the first of a two-part video sequence on a 10 to 15
37.92,59.099000000000004,minutes scientific presentation in this video we'll focus on how to structure that introduction that sets the stage for your talk the second video will focus on the body of the 10 to 15 minute
48.36,75.33,scientific presentation design methods data results and conclusions the focus and this that video is on the overall structure of the rest of your presentation note that the same patterns
61.77,82.37100000000001,can also apply for a longer talk there you expand the scope and/or apply the patterns to a succession of research questions the most effective
72.33,98.05,introduction for an oral presentation follows a classic rhetorical pattern think of buckets where each rhetorical statement you make is placed in its
84.15,105.53900000000002,appropriate bucket in other words you want the statements you make in your introduction to fit a particular pattern and what are the appropriate rhetorical
95.7,126.08000000000001,buckets and their sequence there are four context complication question hypothesis use
109.659,136.149,this C C Q H pattern to shape your introduction it guides the thinking of the viewer like one approaches a scientific problem and it should take you less than a couple of minutes and
122.17,147.371,your 10 to 15-minute talk a good introduction for a 10 to 15 minute presentation puts the science problem in its appropriate buckets that's C CQ h
134.98,158.73899999999998,pattern the first C points to a context your audience understands and accepts there's no dispute about it it's a given then we get to the complications these
149.019,169.36,complications raise a compelling question the complication is a state of uncertainty of the unresolved of the unknown sometimes framed as a set of alternative explanations or an area where knowledge
158.98,180.76,is incomplete or causes are poorly understood and that complication raises a question which is implied or explicitly stated and it's the
169.72,193.39,compelling research science question that addresses that complication and then finally we have the hypothesis so your question offers a testable clear hypothesis that when researched and
181.75,206.408,analyzed will advance knowledge and understanding and the introductory rhetorical pattern is like a funnel moving from the big and the general to
192.849,214.12099999999998,the narrow focus of the hypothesis your context gives the big picture and it's really important to do this because with a good context you connect with the
204.04,229.929,audience your audience may or may not know the specific components of your research the specific technical details this way they see how it relates directly to them next you have the
217.209,237.349,complication that's the issue the problem the hurdle that difficulty the complication tells us what's unknown are uncertain about the issues raised by
227.62,252.969,that context then you have the question the question is raised by that complication and should be answerable in a way that will resolve the complication and then
239.939,261.87,finally we have the hypothesis so the hypothesis focuses not only on the work itself but the presentation the presentation is designed to convey to the audience whether or not you've
251.04,275.221,proven your hypothesis disproven your hypothesis or otherwise raised additional questions as a result of trying to test that hypothesis now let's
263.58,286.049,look at an example based on how to structure an introduction this example is based on a paper entitled amyloid beta protein dimers isolated directly from Alzheimer's brains impaired
273.78,300.121,synaptic plasticity and memory that was published in Nature Medicine in 2008 you can also find a link to the paper on the climb website so here's an example of an
287.88,310.95,introduction it follows the model using the paper we referenced on the previous slide first we have our context the standard view Alzheimer's disease is rising threat to public health it is
299.43,321.17,distinguished from other dementias by abundant extra neural deposits of amyloid beta research shows that neuronal alterations can be induced in the brains of amyloid precursor protein
309.56,332.3,transgenic mice by super physiological concentrations of synthetic amyloid beta peptide z' by amyloid beta species secreted by cultured cells or by mixtures of amyloid beta assembly forms
321.11,346.019,so this is the standard view the linkage is commonly accepted we can induce um ad type activity by placing synthetic amyloid beta into the brains of
333.509,356.29,transgenic mice then we have our complication although these findings show that a beta can alter synapse physiology and experimental models the nature of pathogenic species from the human brain
345.32,369.32,a demonstration of neurobiological facts haven't been shown in other words we know that synthetic and cultured a beta has induced ad but no one has used human
355.67,375.71000000000004,a beta and discovered its effects next we have our question our sperm was designed to take soluble amyloid beta oligomers directly from the cerebral
367.61,392.03000000000003,cortex of deceased subjects with Alzheimer's disease to induce found summer phenotypes in normal adult rodents measuring the effects on synaptic long-term depression and long term potentiation as well as dendritic
378.83,399.09999999999997,density so here we imply the question could human a beta induce AD in transgenic mice and how would it do this
388.6,411.35,and then we have our hypothesize we Apophis eyes that soluble a beta isolated directly from human Alzheimer's disease brain would potently impaired synapse structure and function
400.76,424.7,specifically by the actions of a beta oligomers and dimers so we offer here are clear testable hypothesis that when we research and analyze it will advance
410.66,432.139,knowledge and understanding so what follows is a single PowerPoint slide that organizes an introduction to the amyloid beta protein dimer problem in a
423.29,444.05100000000004,different way in your ten-minute talk you should aim to have your introduction on a single slide so before we talk about the slide look at your watch see
434.27,456.29999999999995,how long it takes to work through this introduction are you ready let's begin so today we're going to talk about our research work which focuses on how
447.31,472.48,amyloid-beta and polygamy dimers isolated from deceased human subjects can impair a synapse structure and function and this research is important
459.43,482.44,because as we all know ad is a critical health problem and the disease is distinguished from other dimensions by the accumulation of amyloid beta in the
470.17,493.48,brains of sufferers of AD now here's what we know and what we don't know experiments have shown that neuronal alterations are induced in mice by using
482.68,507.82,synthetic amyloid beta peptide x' and amyloid beta species from cultured cells and amyloid beta assembly forms but no one has taken soluble a beta extracted
494.83,518.1999999999999,from humans with AD and use that and thus the pathogenic activity from the human species of a bee is unknown so in
506.83,528.55,our experiment we decided to use soluble a beta oligomers isolated from the cerebral cortex of deceased human subjects that had a D in order to induce
518.11,538.1800000000001,the Out's heimer phenotypes in normal adult rodents and our hypothesis is as follows we think that soluable a beta from human
530.99,557.6990000000001,Alzheimer's disease brains would impair synaptic function and structure and we believe that it would do so specifically by the actions of the a beta oligomers
542.66,564.2199999999999,and dimers now how long did that take that introductory slide less than two minutes less than two minutes to set up
554.269,577.499,the entire research problem on one slide now you can see how the rest of the talk is set up everyone knows what it's going to be about and what you're going to try
566.51,588.511,to prove that's why this introductory pattern is so powerful when giving a talk the CC qh pattern is a powerful effective way to structure an
581.83,608.8900000000001,introduction any introduction for talk or a poster or a paper using this pattern the CC qh pattern will help your
595.18,612.05,audience understand exactly the nature of your research work and make for a compelling and easy-to-follow talk
